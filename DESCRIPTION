Description: R6-based tools to cluster variables (numeric, categorical or mixed)
    using k-means, k-modes, k-prototypes and k-medoids. The package provides a 
    unified facade class delegating to specialised engine classes, along with 
    interpretability tools (cluster membership indicators, profiles, inertia 
    path for elbow analysis) and an interactive Shiny application for visual 
    exploration and export of the results.
