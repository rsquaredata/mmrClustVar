## Overview

**mmrClustVar** is an academic project developed as part of the Master 2 SISE (Statistics and Computer Science for Data Science) at **Université Lyon 2**.

The goal is to design a **fully functional R package** that implements several **variable clustering** algorithms provides interpretable outputs for data exploration.

Key features include:  
- Multiple clustering algorithms for quantitative and qualitative variables
- Automatic or assisted determination of the optimal number of clusters
- Built-in interpretability tools: summaries, plots, and metrics
- R6-based architecture by scikit-learn's design
- Interactive **R Shiny** application for hands-on exploration
- Complete help documentation and reproducible GitHub tutorial
